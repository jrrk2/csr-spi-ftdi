This is the LowRISC Nexys4-DDR version of csr-spi-ftdi. It can be used to configure BlueCore04 chips (firmware tested: "cyt_8unified_fl_bt3.0_23i_1002111152_native_encr56 2010-02-11") and possibly others, if you have a [Nexys4-DDR board](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/programmable-logic/nexys-4-ddr/start), a [Digilent PmodBT2](https://reference.digilentinc.com/reference/pmod/pmodbt2/start), and an existing copy of BlueSuite (tested version 2.6.6.1311).
The Nexys board needs to be programmed with [this project](https://github.com/jrrk2/ft2232c_ila).

# CSR BlueCore USB SPI programmer/debugger

[![Download Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/lorf/csr-spi-ftdi.svg?logo=github&label=download)](https://github.com/lorf/csr-spi-ftdi/releases/latest)

This is USB SPI programmer and debugger for CSR BlueCore bluetooth chips, based
on FTDI FT232R USB to UART converter chip. Programmer hardware can be made
using simple FT232RL breakout board, or built as a dedicated programmer using
included schematic. Programmer driver works by replacing USB SPI programmer
driver, usbspi.dll, in CSR applications and is currently ported to Linux/Wine
and Windows.

Project home page: <https://github.com/lorf/csr-spi-ftdi>.

## CSR chips supported by programmer

Generally, all CSR BlueCore chips starting with BlueCore 2 should be supported.
Programmer was tested with the following chips:

* BC417143 (on HC-05 module)
* BC57F687A
* CSR8645
* BC212015 (reported by Alex Nuc, see [Chip notes](#chip-notes))

### Chip notes

* BlueCore chips require either 3.3V or 1.8V I/O voltage level. Check the
  datasheet.
* Some chips (like CSR8645) share SPI pins with PCM function. For such chips to
  be accessible via SPI, `SPI_PCM#` pin should be pulled up to I/O voltage
  supply through a 10K resistor.
* On some chips `SPI_DEBUG_EN` (on BC6140) or `SPI_PIO#` (on CSR1010) pin
  should be pulled up directly to I/O voltage supply to enable SPI port.
* BlueCore chips which integrate battery charger has charger configuration
  enabled by default. Such chip may shutdown shortly after power on if You
  don't connect charged battery. Battery charger configuration is defined in
  `PSKEY_USR0` and can be changed using appropriate Configuration Tool or
  PSTool. See sample PSR files for disabling charger in [misc/](misc/).
* BlueCore 2 chips (such as BC212015) are not supported in BlueSuite 2.4 and
  above. It's also reported that to flash/dump these chips it's required to
  lower SPI speed. So for BC2 chips it's recommended to use BlueSuite 2.3 and
  set `SPIMAXCLOCK=200` [option](#options).

## Programmer hardware

Programmer hardware is based on FT232R chip. It is possible that later
generation FTDI chips, such as FT2232C/D/H or FT232H, will also work, but this
was not tested.

### Using FT232RL breakout board as a programmer

You can build a simple programmer using popular FT232RL breakout boards (search
Ebay for "FT232RL adapter" for example). Pinout specified in spi.c file.
Change it at will. Note that FTDI boards usually provide 5V or 3.3V I/O levels
while CSR chips require 3.3V or 1.8V I/O level. You may supply appropriate
VCCIO to FTDI chip or use logic level converter if levels don't match. See
description of VCCIO pin in FTDI chip datasheet for details.

This is a default pinout:

| Signal | FT232RL pin | FTDI pin name | FTDI GPIO bit | CSR pin  |
|--------|-------------|---------------|---------------|----------|
| CS#    | 2           | DTR#          | D4            | SPI_CS#  |
| CLK    | 3           | RTS#          | D2            | SPI_CLK  |
| MOSI   | 6           | RI#           | D7            | SPI_MOSI |
| MISO   | 9           | DSR#          | D5            | SPI_MISO |
| TX     | 1           | TXD           | Not used      | UART_RX  |
| RX     | 5           | RXD           | Not used      | UART_TX  |
| LED_RD | 10          | DCD#          | D6            | --       |
| LED_WR | 11          | CTS#          | D3            | --       |
| GND    | 7, 18, 21   | GND           | --            | GND      |

SPI and UART BlueCore pins could be connected directly to FTDI pins, but I'd
recommend to wire them through the 220 Ohm (or so) resistors.

TX and RX connections are optional and provide connectivity to BlueCore UART.

LED connections are optional. Wire LED cathodes through the current limiting
resistors (330 Ohm works fine) to the appropriate FTDI
pins. Wire LED anodes to FTDI 3V3 pin.

Other pinouts can be specified with `FTDI_PINOUT` [Option](#options).

Don't power BlueCore chip from FT232R internal 3.3V regulator! It's current
draw may exceed FT232R 50mA limit, which may cause communication errors.

Also see notes on [Counterfeit FT232RL chips](#counterfeit-ft232rl-chips).

### Dedicated programmer

KiCad schematic for a dedicated programmer can be found in
[hardware/](hardware/) subdirectory.

### Counterfeit FT232RL chips

Cheap (< $5) FT232RL modules usually contain counterfeit FT232RL chips
([1](http://zeptobars.ru/en/read/FTDI-FT232RL-real-vs-fake-supereal),
[2](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/reviews/ftdi-driver-kills-fake-ftdi-ft232/msg536891/#msg536891),
[3](http://dangerousprototypes.com/forum/viewtopic.php?p=56343#p56343)).  I've
got such chip (this one has read-only EEPROM, S/N A50285BI, probably it's a
[generation 2 counterfeit](https://blog.cesanta.com/FTDI-adventures)) and
verified csr-spi-ftdi to work with it.

There is a known data loss issue with counterfeit FT232RL chip and ASM1042 USB
3.0 controller. If You encounter it (You'll get an error on stderr, see
[Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting)), try to replug the programmer to other
controller. Note that genuine FT232RL works fine with this controller.

Counterfeit IC also may produce some communication errors, but they are
automatically retried, so in general it works well enough.

Some versions of Windows FTDI driver tend to intentionally
[brick](https://hackaday.com/2014/10/22/watch-that-windows-update-ftdi-drivers-are-killing-fake-chips/)
1st generation counterfeit chips by setting their PID to 0x0000. There
are
[unbrick](https://www.reddit.com/r/arduino/comments/2k0i7x/watch_that_windows_update_ftdi_drivers_are/clgviyl)
([2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZH_qGautqM)) and
[protect](http://www.eevblog.com/forum/reviews/ftdi-driver-kills-fake-ftdi-ft232/msg537012/#msg537012)
procedures, but csr-spi-ftdi will work on the bricked chips too.


## Software

### CSR software

This driver is tested with CSR BlueSuite 2.1 - 2.6.0 and with CSR BlueLab 4.1,
but should work with other CSR software, such as SDK, ADK, Configuration Tool,
Parameter Manager. Newer versions of BlueSuite can be found at
`https://www.csrsupport.com/PCSW`. Older versions of BlueSuite can be found at
`https://www.csrsupport.com/PCSWArchive`. Access to these pages requires
registration.

### Installing prebuilt drivers

Prebuilt drivers for Linux and Windows can be downloaded from
<https://github.com/lorf/csr-spi-ftdi/releases/latest>.

#### Installing on Ubuntu/Debian Linux

Install Wine:

    sudo apt-get install wine

Install CSR BlueSuite in Wine. Find all instances of usbspi.dll installed and
move them out of the way:

    find ~/.wine -iname usbspi.dll -exec mv {} {}.orig \;

Copy usbspi.dll.so to Wine system directory:

    sudo cp -p lib-wine-linux/usbspi.dll.so /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/wine/

Alternately You can specify location of the .dll.so file in WINEDLLPATH
environment variable, see wine(1) man page for details.

Allow yourself access to FTDI device

    cat <<_EOT_ | sudo tee -a /etc/udev/rules.d/99-ftdi.rules
    # FT232R
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", MODE="0660", GROUP="plugdev"
    _EOT_

After that You'll need to add yourself to `plugdev` group and relogin.


#### Installing on Windows

1. Install CSR package such as BlueSuite;
2. Make a backup of usbspi.dll in your application directory (e.g. in
   `C:\Program Files (x86)\CSR\BlueSuite 2.6.0\`);
3. Copy lib-win32/usbspi.dll to your application directory;
4. Connect Your FTDI device to computer;
5. Download and run Zadig from <http://zadig.akeo.ie/>. In Options menu choose
   "List all devices", choose Your FTDI device ("FT232R USB UART" or similar),
   choose libusbK driver, press "Replace driver" or "Install driver".  This
   will install generic libusb-compatible driver for your FTDI chip. There is a
   tutorial on running libftdi programs on Windows here:
   <http://embedded-funk.net/running-libftdi-under-windows/>;
6. Run your CSR apps.

### Using the driver

#### Choosing USB transport

Older BlueSuite defaults to use CSR SPI LPT programmer, to use csr-spi-ftdi You
need to select USB SPI transport. Use `-TRANS "SPITRANS=USB SPIPORT=1"` option
for command line tools. Import
[misc/spi-set-usb-transport.reg](misc/spi-set-usb-transport.reg) to change the
default.

#### Options

Csr-spi-ftdi driver supports several options that can be set as environment
variables or using the -TRANS option to most CSR commandline apps.

* `SPIMAXCLOCK` - Maximum SPI clock frequency in kHz, default is 1000.
  Practical values range from 20 to 2000. CSR app may slow SPI clock down when
  read or write verification fails. Some commands are always executed at 20
  kHz.
* `FTDI_LOG_LEVEL` - sets csr-spi-ftdi log level, available log levels:
  `quiet`, `err`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`. Adding a `,dump` option provides hex
  dumps of transferred data. Example: `FTDI_LOG_LEVEL=info,dump`. Default:
  `warn`.
* `FTDI_LOG_FILE` - specify log file name. Can be set to `stdout` to log to
  standard output, or to `stderr` to log to standard error stream. Default:
  `stderr`.
* `FTDI_INTERFACE` (since version 0.5.1) - specify interface on multi-interface
  chips (FT2232, FT4232). Default: `A`.
* `FTDI_PINOUT` (since version 0.5.2) - specify a pinout. Available pinouts:
  * `default` - default pinout as described in [Using FT232RL breakout board as
    a programmer](#using-ft232rl-breakout-board-as-a-programmer).
  * `noleds` - this is the same as `default` but without LEDs.
  * `hwspi` - pinout for use with MPSSE chips (FT2232, FT4232, FT232H), uses
    the same pins as hardware SPI. Note that hardware SPI capability is not
    used, just the same pinout is used for convenience. This pinout can be used
    with adapters like [TIAO
    TUMPA](http://www.tiaowiki.com/w/TIAO_USB_Multi_Protocol_Adapter_User's_Manual).
    The pinout is as follows: `CS` - `DBUS3`, `CLK` - `DBUS0`, `MOSI` -
    `DBUS1`, `MISO` - `DBUS2`.
  * `hwspi+leds` - this is the same as `hwspi` but adds read and write LEDs on
    `DBUS4` and `DBUS5` pins respectively.

For other options see [misc/transport-options.md](misc/transport-options.md).

#### Communication speed

Reading or writing a 1 MB flash on HC-05 module takes about 60 seconds. Dumping
HC-05 PS keys takes about 40 seconds.

Running csr-spi-ftdi in a virtual machine slows things down presumably due to
latency added by USB virtualization. E.g. running csr-spi-ftdi under VirtualBox
slows transactions down about 4x times.

#### Useful commands

These commands should be executed from directory where BlueSuite is installed
or this directory should be in your PATH.

* Display chip ID, this is also a quick communication test:

        BlueFlashCmd.exe -chipver

* Display chip ID, firmware version and flash size:

        BlueFlashCmd.exe -identify

* Save firmware backup (only for chips with flash, backup will include PS
  keys):

        BlueFlashCmd.exe -dump csr-fw-backup

  This creates two files, `csr-fw-backup.xpv` and `csr-fw-backup.xdv`.

* Flash firmware from files `csr-fw.xpv` and `csr-fw.xdv`:

        BlueFlashCmd.exe csr-fw

* Collect debug logs:

        BlueFlashCmd.exe -trans "SPIDEBUG=ON \
            SPIDEBUG_FILE=csr-spi-debug.log FTDI_LOG_LEVEL=debug,dump \
            FTDI_LOG_FILE=ftdi-debug.log" -identify

* Lower SPI speed 5 times:

        BlueFlashCmd.exe -trans SPIMAXCLOCK=200 -dump csr-fw-backup

* Save chip settings (PS Keys) backup into `csr-pskeys.psr`:

        pscli.exe dump csr-pskeys.psr

* Merge some settings from `pskeys.psr` to the chip:

        pscli.exe merge pskeys.psr

* Backup whole EEPROM image to a file:

        e2cmd.exe dump eeprom-backup.hex

* Restore EEPROM contents from backup file:

        e2cmd.exe download eeprom-backup.hex

#### Troubleshooting

* Decreasing SPI speed using `SPIMAXCLOCK` [option](#options) may help in case
  of communication failures.
* `Unable to start read (invalid control data)` errors are usually harmless,
  since read attempts are retried. If You've got a pile of theese errors and
  programmer doesn't work - check connections, voltage levels, try to lower SPI
  connection resistor values or connecting ~ 1nF capacitors in parallel with
  resistors. Decreasing SPI speed using `SPIMAXCLOCK` [option](#options) may
  also help.
* `WARNING: Attempt %d to read sector %d` warnings are also harmless if they are
  not result in error.
* `Couldn't find LPT port` error means You use spilpt.dll driver instead of
  usbspi.dll. Try importing
  [misc/spi-set-usb-transport.reg](misc/spi-set-usb-transport.reg) or adding
  `-trans "SPITRANS=USB SPIPORT=1"` option on command line.
* `Lost %d of %d bytes of data in transit` or `ERROR: Download Failed, Sector
  %d` - probably an indication of counterfeit FT232RL plugged into ASM1042 USB
  3.0 controller. Try to replug into other controller. See [Counterfeit FT232RL
  chips](#counterfeit-ft232rl-chips).

### Bugs

* See [Issues on github](https://github.com/lorf/csr-spi-ftdi/issues) to list
  current bug reports or to report a bug.
* Current implementation of 1.4 SPI API (used in BlueSuite starting from 2.4)
  is based on a wild guess and is just a wrapper around 1.3 functions. It
  doesn't support multiple programmers connected at the same time and may
  contain other bugs.
